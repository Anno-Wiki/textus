We're delighted to announce that [JISC][1] will be funding the initial development of the [TEXTUS][2] platform as part of its [Digital Infrastructure Programme][3].

TEXTUS will be a lightweight, easy-to-use platform that will enable users to read, share and collaborate around public domain texts.

It will use tools already developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation such as the [Annotator][4] and build on the OKFN humanities projects such as [Open Shakespeare][5].

[Goldsmiths University][6] will lead the project with technical development and community work to be undertaken by the [Open Knowledge Foundation][7].

## Open Philosophy

The six-month JISC funded project will focus on developing a first instance of TEXTUS to be deployed as Open Philosophy on [openphilosophy.org][8]. Open Philosophy – which will focus on providing access to and encouraging scholarly collaboration around philosophy texts – will be developed in close consultation with the project's academic advisory board, students from Goldsmiths University and project partners [Oxford][9] and [Royal Holloway][10].

It is one of the main goals of the project to develop a tool that can be used by students and scholars to enrich their teaching and research, so user-centric design principles will be followed throughout to ensure that real researcher needs are addressed appropriately. There is a [dedicated Open Philosophy mailing list][11] that will focus on discussions about the content to be made available on [openphilosophy.org][8] which you can sign up to [here][11].
