This morning I trundled along to Goldsmiths University of London to spend a couple of hours with Aya Hino, a PhD student closely involved with TEXTUS, and who was was kind enough to allow me to document her morning while she went about her daily research business.

Aya, like most humanities researchers today, still chooses to work with paper for the most part. She uses a word processor to write up her work, but the process leading up to this is dominated by good old ink and dead trees.

Like any good humanist, most of Aya's time is spent reading books. But in oder to get round to this, Aya's first point of call is the library. She identifies the book she wants on the computer terminals and uses an index to locate the sections of text that interest her.

With TEXTUS, of course, this would be a whole lot simpler and a lot more powerful. Given that indexes vary in their reliability and by their vary nature only pick out a sub-set of relevant terms contained within a work, the option supported by TEXTUS to find all instances of a given word would allow for much more fine grained searching than indexes generally allow for. On top of this, TEXTUS will give you the ability to search for a given term across a set of texts, an incredibly useful function that would be extremely time consuming for any researcher to emulate using paper indexes.

From time to time Aya annotated **her** books with marginalia. It was apparent when we visited the library that this was a rather popular practice involving books belonging to the library,&nbsp;[much to the dismay of the librarians][4]!

Of course, we all know that marginalia in university books varies in quality. Some of it is&nbsp;inane, but some of it is valuable information about texts that could be usefully shared with others you are working with or students you are teaching.

By default, TEXTUS will display a "clean" version of a text that displays only your annotations, so that you are not hampered when reading by annotations you don't want to see. TEXTUS gives you the option of choosing whose annotations your browser displays, supporting focussed collaboration.

Aya also maintained a rather impressive set of hand written notes, often based on the annotations she'd made in her books. One of the things that I noticed Aya doing was returning to her notes to add additional information through using post-its and highlighting.

The ability to augment annotations with additional information is something we've been thinking hard about at TEXTUS HQ, and it must be supported by the platform if TEXTUS really is to rival the traditional paper work flow. Allowing annotations to be annotated is also an essential part of encouraging the thing that academics love the most â€“ debate!

Aya's diagrammatic notes and mind maps also made we wonder, how might TEXTUS support more visual ways of working with texts and concepts? Ideas on the back of a postcard to [open-humanities@lists.okfn.org][8]

Like many PhD students, Aya also teaches undergraduates. This often involves the onerous and expensive task of photocopying collections of works for inclusion within course readers and for distribution before lectures.

TEXTUS aims to make this process easier by enabling teachers to share collections of readings they have selected for inclusion in a course. Links to freely available electronic versions of these texts or excerpts are embedded in the lists TEXTUS produces, saving a whole lot of paper and time sweating over the photocopier.

After a couple of hours, I left Aya in peace to read in the quiet of the library. To enable users to read and think, without getting in the way, is after all the most important thing that TEXTUS must do if it is to be of value to scholars and students!
