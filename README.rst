Textus_ is a toolbox and web application for working with and presenting textual material
from shakespeare to schopenhauer, and letters to literature.

Textus represents the evolution of more than 6 years of software development,
building as it does on the OpenShakspeare platform (which powered
http://openshakespeare.org from 2005 until 2011) and the OpenCorrespondence
system (which powered http://opencorrespondence.org from 2009-2011).
