title: Annotations Mock-Up

We have a new mock-up of the TEXTUS annotation system based on the feedback we've been given since the project kicked off.

![][1]

It contains all the key ingredients of the annotation system as it will exist in TEXTUS.

On the mock-up we can see how TEXTUS might represent a number of different types of annotation:

1. Comments or marginalia display inline in the right hand column and can be scrolled if there are too many to display. The text, however, won't scroll but will be a fixed paginated experience instead for ease of reading.

2. Structural annotations can also be inserted with the help of the arrow markers along the side. These annotations will help the TEXTUS renderer to display texts correctly with the right gaps between paragraphs etc.

3. We also have translation annotations. These may however become very long so it isn't sensible to display them inline as we do for comments. Instead the user can click on icon in the top right to bring up the translations that apply to the text in view.

4. The same applies to scanned pages of texts which are, in a sense, a class of annotations as they apply to a specific character range. We don't want to see them like the comments or marginalia as this would just clutter the page â€” we want to be able to open up a different view should we need to looks a original scans.

Another key point to note is that the number of annotations is given for each level of structure. This allows users to make comments about a whole chapter or verse of a poem without having to arbitrarily insert it into some line. The number of annotations per level of structure is given in the "bread crumb" trail in the top left of the screen.

It would be great to hear what you think about this mock-up so that we can tweak and adjust what we've got in the lead up to our beta release in a couple of months. So we'd very much appreciate your comments below!
