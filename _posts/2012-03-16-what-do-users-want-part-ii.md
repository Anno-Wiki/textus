Armed with our set of [user interface mock-ups][1] I went to visit the group of students who we had first met back in February for our [initial user requirements workshop][2] to see what they thought of what we'd come up with.

Here is a brief summary of the thoughts sparked by inspection of the user interface mock-ups:

* Whether we display texts with a paginated or scrolling view what is important is that users can still skim read. It was suggested that it was easier to skim read using scrolling text displays. The most important thing, however, was that the reader was able to see what was coming next. Scenarios were envisaged where you could see thumbnails in the margins of pages surrounding the passage that you were currently on.
* It was once again highlighted how desirable it would be to have TEXTUS easily integrate with existing reference management softwares such as EndNote and Zotero. It should be made easy to quote a passage of text in TEXTUS and automatically copy over the URI of that quote into your preferred reference management software.
* Annotations _must_ clearly display who they are by. Solid accreditation is essential if you want to encourage scholars to undertake publicly available work on the system.
* A very important use case for TEXTUS was pointed out â€” course readers! Currently universities such as Goldsmiths pay a lot of money to produce paper photocopies of key passages of text for use on courses. If these texts were available in TEXTUS this process would be a lot cheaper, easier to manage while also presenting new ways of working those texts and building on the work done on them with previous groups.
* A fantastic resource was pointed out for Philosophy reading lists that we will be looking closely at for our initial source material for [Open Philosophy][3]. It can be found here: [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/LPSG/](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/LPSG/) (Thanks Philipp!)

We'll be working hard in the coming weeks to take into account all these suggestions and make sure that they are catered for in the final release of TEXTUS.
