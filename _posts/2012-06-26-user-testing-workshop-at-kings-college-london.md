The first of our two TEXTUS user testing sessions this week took place at the [King’s College London Digital Humanities Department](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/index.aspx).

A small group of Digital Humanists, including OpenPhilosophy.org [Advisory Board](http://openphilosophy.org/about/) member Dr Tobias Blanke, gathered to probe TEXTUS’s growing set of functionality and to share their wisdom from numerous other software projects they’d been involved with in the humanities.

We complied a list of comments about the key areas of functionality currently extant on [beta.openphilosophy.org](http://beta.openphilosophy.org/)

## Reading

* Bug that means pagination sometime occurs mid sentence.

## Importing

* Arabic texts are currently not right justifying as they should;
* TEI support should be in place so that existing TEI documents can easily be ingested.

## Annotation

* Should be a close button on the annotation window;
* An option to hide annotations;
* Annotation window currently obscures the text.

## Other Functionalities

We also discussed new functionality that participants felt would be useful:

* Import to Google Docs;
* Plug-ins to embed TEXTUS texts in popular CMSs such as Word Press;
* Allow log-in using Open ID;
* Interoperability with existing bibliographic metadata services already used (e.g. Zotero and End Note);
* Group management for annotations, allowing sets of users to share annotations amongst themselves only.

## Other relevant projects identified

* [OCRopodium](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/digitisation/econtent/ocr.aspx) – an open source OCR project funded by JISC;
* [CLÉA](http://www.catma.de/webfm_send/22) – an annotation environment for Google Books;
* [Prism](http://prism.scholarslab.org/) – a tool for visualising readings of a commons set of texts.

We will be compiling a list of open source annotation tools to go alongside on the one we’re compiling of [open source transcription list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-humanities) on the [Open Humanities discussion list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-humanities), so please join the discussion there, if you have some items you’d like to add.
